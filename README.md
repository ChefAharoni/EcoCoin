# EcoCoin #

A college based, independent research project, that focuses on the development of a green blockchain token. The aim is to create an environmentally friendly digital currency that can be earned by participating in recycling programs.

The concept of the token is based on a decentralized platform that incentivizes individuals to recycle bottles and spend their earnings at local shops. Participants will receive digital credits for each bottle they recycle. These credits can then be exchanged for goods and services or converted into traditional currency.

The token will be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, most probably on a testnet to avoid security issues that might end up users losing all their funds.
