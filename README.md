# EcoCoin 🌱💰

Welcome to EcoCoin, a college-based independent research project that aims to revolutionize recycling through blockchain technology. 🌍♻️ Earn an environmentally friendly digital currency by participating in recycling programs and contribute to a sustainable future.

## Concept 📝

EcoCoin introduces a decentralized platform that incentivizes individuals to recycle plastic bottles. Here's how it works:

1. **Recycling**: Participants recycle plastic bottles and receive digital credits for each bottle.
2. **Rewards**: These credits can be exchanged for goods, services, or converted into traditional currency.
3. **Local Impact**: By spending earnings at local shops, you support your community and promote eco-conscious choices.

## How It Works 🔄

- The contract is initially deployed by the genesis municipality.
- Genesis municipality assigns other municipalities, which inherit the same permissions.
- Municipalities register machines and shops; recyclers do not require approval.
